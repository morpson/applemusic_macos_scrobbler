This tool automatically scrobbles your currently playing Apple Music tracks to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm). It runs in the background on macOS using AppleScript and a `launchd` service.

---

## üöÄ One-Step Automatic Installation

For the fastest setup after cloning, **run our automatic setup script**. It will:
- Ensure the main script is executable
- Personalize and install the LaunchAgent plist with your username and correct script/log paths
- Guide you through credential setup with the appropriate method
- Reload and start the scrobbler service

**Usage:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morpson/applemusic_macos_scrobbler.git
cd applemusic_macos_scrobbler
chmod +x setup_scrobbler.sh
./setup_scrobbler.sh
```

Just follow the prompts. Once complete, the scrobbler will autostart with macOS login.

> **Tip:** For most users, this is all you need!  
> You can still follow the advanced/manual instructions below for greater control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* macOS with Apple Music app
* A Last.fm account
* [Last.fm API account](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) (to obtain your API key & secret)
* Command line tools: `bash`, `osascript`, `curl`, and one of `md5sum` (via `coreutils`) or `md5` (native on macOS)

---

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morpson/applemusic_macos_scrobbler.git
cd applemusic_macos_scrobbler
```

2. **Install the scrobbler script:**

You can install the script either in your home directory or keep it in the cloned repository:

```bash
# Option 1: Install to home directory (recommended for regular use)
cp apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh ~/
chmod +x ~/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh

# Option 2: Keep it in the repository (easier for development)
chmod +x ./apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh
```

3. **Install the launch agent:**

The launch agent makes the scrobbler start automatically when you log in:

#### a. Edit the plist file

Open `com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist` in a text editor.

- Change all `/Users/USERNAME/...` paths to match **your** user directory and the actual location of your `apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh` script, e.g.:
    - `/Users/yourname/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh`
    - `/Users/yourname/Library/Logs/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.log`

#### b. Install the plist

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```

> **Note:** If you chose Option 2 in step 2, you'll need to ensure the plist file points to the correct script location in the repository.

## üîê Set Up Your Last.fm Credentials

To allow the script to scrobble to your Last.fm account, you'll need a **session key**. We provide two options:

### üîÅ Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run this script to guide you through the process of authenticating with Last.fm and updating the main script:

```bash
./get_lastfm_session_key.sh
```

This script will:

* Prompt for your **API key** and **API secret**
* Open the authorization URL in your browser
* Ask you to paste in the returned **token**
* Exchange it for a **session key**
* Insert all three values into your scrobbler script

‚úÖ At the end, the script will automatically start the background scrobbler service.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Manual Setup (if you already have credentials)

If you already have:

* An **API key**
* An **API secret**
* A valid **session key**

Then run:

```bash
./update_scrobbler_credentials.sh
```

It will prompt you for these values and update the scrobbler script accordingly.

---

### üîí Option 3: Secure Credentials Storage (Enhanced Security)

For enhanced security, you can store your Last.fm API credentials in the macOS Keychain rather than directly in the script:

```bash
chmod +x ./secure_credentials.sh
./secure_credentials.sh store
```

This will:

* Prompt you for your **API key**, **API secret**, and **session key**
* Store all credentials securely in the macOS Keychain
* Update the scrobbler script to load credentials from the Keychain
* No sensitive information will be stored in the script file itself

To verify your credentials are properly stored and accessible:

```bash
./secure_credentials.sh test
```

If you want to revert back to storing credentials in the script file, set `USE_KEYCHAIN=false` in the script and run the update_scrobbler_credentials.sh script to set them directly.

---

## üîÑ Start the Scrobbler

Once your credentials are set, start the service:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist
launchctl start com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler
```

To restart or reload:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Common Fresh Clone Issues

- **Service doesn't start?**
    - Make sure the plist file is present at `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, has your correct username in all script/log paths, and is readable.
    - Check the output of `log show --predicate 'process == "apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh"' --info --last 1h` for details.
    - Make sure your script is executable: `chmod +x ~/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh`.

- **No logs?**
    - Confirm your log path in the plist and the script match, and are writable by you.

- **Credentials not recognized?**
    - Ensure you've followed the credential setup process described above‚Äîeither via the helper scripts or Keychain.

## ‚úÖ Quickstart after Clone

1. Clone the repository and make the script executable.
2. Edit the plist file with your correct username and paths.
3. Install the plist to your LaunchAgents directory.
4. Run either `./get_lastfm_session_key.sh`, `./update_scrobbler_credentials.sh`, or `./secure_credentials.sh store` to initialize credentials.
5. Load the LaunchAgent as shown above.
6. Play a track and check your log: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.log`.

---

## üß™ Test It Works

Play a track in Apple Music. Then check the logs:

```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.log
```

You should see output indicating the currently playing track and scrobble status. The script checks for new tracks every 30 seconds by default. You can adjust this interval by changing the `POLL_INTERVAL` value in the script if you prefer more or less frequent checks.

---

## üßπ Uninstall

To remove the scrobbler:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.plist
rm ~/apple_music_lastfm_scrobbler.sh
```

---

## üîí Security Note

Do **not** share your API key, API secret, or session key publicly. The scripts are designed to prompt for your credentials securely ‚Äî no sensitive data is stored in version control.

For even better security, consider storing your credentials in the macOS Keychain instead of directly in the script.
